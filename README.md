# Python Projects - Engeto Course

This repository contains Python projects assigned during the Engeto Python course.  Each project is designed to practice and improve learned skills in Python, such as working with data structures, loops, functions, etc.

## Projects

### 1. Text Analyzer
A program that analyzes a given text and provides statistics like:
- Word count
- Number of titlecase, uppercase, and lowercase words
- Count and sum of numeric values in the text

### 2. Cow and Bull Game

The "Cow and Bull" game is a number guessing game where the user tries to guess a 4-digit secret number. For each guess, the program provides feedback in terms of:

- **Cows**: The number of digits guessed correctly in both number and position.
- **Bulls**: The number of digits guessed correctly, but in the wrong position.

#### Game Flow:

1. The program generates a random 4-digit number.
2. The user makes guesses.
3. After each guess, the program returns:
    - The number of cows (correct digit and position).
    - The number of bulls (correct digit but wrong position).
4. The game continues until the user guesses the secret number correctly (i.e., 4 cows).
